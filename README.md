# USING AI TO POWER MARKETING: ADOBE CASE STUDY

While we may not realize it, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been around for a long time. In 1950, British mathematician, Alan Turing, wrote a paper entitled, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” which put forth the idea of “thinking machines.” [1] In 1956, John McCarthy, a mathematics professor at Dartmouth College, organized a workshop to further elaborate on thoughts around “thinking machines.” This workshop included other scholars, as well as people from IBM and Bell Labs. The summer program was known as the “Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence,” and is credited to being the catalyst that led to AI research.[2]  

Fast forward to today, where AI has become in many ways, incorporated into our daily lives through IoT (Internet of Things), Smartphones, and even the cars we drive with mechanisms for self-driving, lane changing and parking. The majority of fields that people work in are often using AI, or subsets of AI such as machine learning. For example, if you’re a data analyst, you are likely running automated processes to pull data into a dashboard that displays it for you. You don’t really think about collecting, vetting and displaying data as being based on AI or machine learning, but it most likely is, since the software you are probably using is also leveraging AI and machine learning to complete these tasks. 

If you work in digital marketing for any length of time, you will learn a great deal about machine learning that tries to determine customer behavior, or how machine learning helps deliver an ad to a person at the right time. This is due to research and discoveries that have been made regarding machine learning and the use of AI.

To get a better view and understanding of how companies may leverage AI, let’s take a look at a company that has been creating and developing products utilizing AI and machine learning, Adobe.
## Overview and Origin
Adobe began in 1982 as Adobe Systems, Inc., when it was founded by John Warnock and Chales Geschke, who had been working together at Xerox. The company was named “Adobe” after a creek that flowed behind Warnock’s home. 

Warnock and Geschke had been involved in developing a language that enabled Xerox printers to talk to computers known as Interpress. Xerox made this their internal standard, but had no desire to license the technology commercially, which is what Warnock and Geschke wanted. The pair left Xerox and created a new language enabling computers to “tell” printers how text and images should render on paper. The initial thought was to take this language, known as PostScript, and use it to offer printing services to companies, as well as consumers. However, financial advisors suggested otherwise, and Warnock and Geschke focused on making PostScript portable. PostScript was issued with Apple’s LaserWriter printer in 1985 and in 1986, IBM PCs were also equipped with PostScript. Additionally in 1986, Adobe held its initial public offering. In 1988, Adobe had become an $83 million company. [3]

From these beginnings, Adobe has grown into a highly valued company offering cloud-based products and services that cover the full spectrum of creating content, publishing content, analyzing content, and using the content to drive marketing efforts including audience development and campaign management. In 2016, the company released Adobe Sensei, its own AI to aid in the workflow and development of products including those that offer marketing segmentation and predictive modeling. [4] In 2023, the company acquired Rephrase.ai, a platform that uses AI to create high quality, professional videos from text. [5] Also in 2023, Adobe released Firefly, a generative AI model that is built on Adobe Sensei. 

Today Adobe has annual revenues of more than $19 billion. [6] Adobe has raised $2.5 million in funding, but its last funding round was in 1984. [7] The company has grown through numerous acquisitions and the sales of its products and services to individual creators as well as large enterprise companies. 

## Business Activities

With its mission as “Changing the world through personalized digital experiences,” [8] Adobe is a multi-faceted company tackling many issues companies and individual creators face. Let’s say you’re a company that sells athletic clothing online, but you’re unsure of who your customers really are and how you can reach them. Adobe can help you identify audiences, offer personalized shopping experiences, and determine the appropriate mix for your media buy. If you’re an ad agency who needs help developing rich and engaging digital ads, as well as managing all of your projects, Adobe can provide tools to create amazing content, and products to help manage all of your projects and their corresponding assets. As an individual creator who needs to develop engaging content in several different versions and variations, Adobe can enable you to provide a variety of looks of the same image through its generative AI capabilities or by using prompts, create a completely different image. These challenges of identifying audiences, managing projects and developing a variety of assets to show a client choices of backgrounds, are what Adobe desires to solve. 

Adobe’s customers range from individual creators to students, small businesses, nonprofits and large scale enterprise companies whose goals are to create and increase revenue opportunities. While Adobe doesn’t have a single market it solely operates in, its footprint spans many sectors of business, technology and commerce. A few of the main companies using Adobe products and services are Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines and Ford Motor Company. At Adobe Summit earlier this year, Delta Airlines boasted themselves as being the fifth largest e-tailer behind Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Apple. [9] Delta Airlines CEO, Ed Bastian, attributed this success in part due to running their marketing efforts on the Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe’s own proprietary technology that powers many of the Experience Cloud and marketing functions.

According to Statista, the largest portion of Adobe’s revenue is due to Adobe’s Creative Cloud subscriptions, which has over 30 million subscribers. Adobe’s Experience Cloud offering that contains tools for audience segmentation and web analytics, which is often used by large enterprise companies, contributes to over 20% of the company’s revenue. [10] 

Adobe’s unique selling position is that it is a full comprehensive solution that offers the ability to create content, display content, capture data about who interacted with the content and realizing what action drove the content forward to a sale or other activities. Additionally, it has grown through acquisitions of market leaders that have enabled the company to further its presence and use. For example, in 2009 Adobe acquired Omniture, a leading web analytics platform, which paved the way for companies to continually rely on Adobe Analytics. [11]

Currently, Adobe continues to further the use of AI in its products, building on top of its release of Adobe Sensei, which is its own proprietary AI technology. Earlier this year, Adobe unveiled generative AI inside of Firefly, enabling more capabilities for content creation. Moreover, Adobe relies on other technologies and languages including RESTful APIs, JupyterLab, Python and SQL/Postgres. [12]

## Landscape
As a considerable leader in the technology arena as well as the MarTech space, Adobe continues to develop products that companies and organizations can use to improve digital experiences for their customers. 

Prior to the recent rise of ChatGPT and the proliferation of AI tools now available, trends and innovations in the digital media realm have largely centered on developing CDPs (Customer Data Platforms) and being able to have data available in real time so you can effectively deliver a digital message at the right time leading up to or at the point of sale. Now with AI being at the forefront, trends are shifting into how AI can be incorporated into CDPs, but even more so, how AI can be used to develop content in richer and quicker ways, known as “Generative AI.” AI and LLMs (Large Language Models) are also changing the landscape of SEO, where much of SEO is now being driven by LLMs and AI. [13]

Adobe competes with Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, and others including Kissmetrics and Canva. What is interesting to note is that even though Adobe competes with Mircosoft, Salesforce, Google and others, they also have partnerships with these companies. For example, earlier this year, Adobe and Microsoft announced connecting Adobe Experience Cloud capabilities with Microsoft Copilot to further improve Generative AI functionality. [14] 

## Results

Adobe has enabled companies to see better ROI on their marketing efforts by offering a suite of products to reach customers and effectively create engaging experiences for them. 87% of Fortune 100 companies use Adobe Experience Cloud. More than 60 industry analysts have named Adobe Experience Cloud products as leaders in their respective categories. Additionally, Adobe Analytics analyzes over 1 trillion visits to US retail websites on a monthly basis and has a goal to be operating at 100% renewable electricity by 2025. [15]

Core metrics will vary in the digital media area depending on if you are developing content, creating campaigns or analyzing data to deliver a next best action on a customer journey. However, companies will rely on data from research organizations such as Gartner and Forrester to set criteria, as well as their own requirements. Adobe has historically been noted as a top provider and market leader in research reports from these two companies. [16]

## Recommendations

Adobe may want to consider improving their customer service and product support areas as it can be difficult to get a response when you have an issue with a tool or run into a problem. They have a community of users known as Experience League which is similar to Reddit, where you can ask questions of other Adobe users in a community forum. However, it can be challenging to search and get an answer specific to your issue. 

Adobe is already offering the ability to create and manipulate images and now will be extending the ability to create videos from text, equipping people with more tools in their creative arsenal. Since AI is ever increasing, it would benefit Adobe to step up research in this area and look at how AI can be further leveraged when it comes to developing audiences and customer journeys to make it easier for people who may not be familiar with how Adobe tools work. 

Additionally, Adobe recently developed a pricing structure that is more within reach for small businesses, but could still be difficult to pursue depending on the size of the business. However, since small businesses account for 46.4% of employees in the private sector [17], Adobe may want to consider developing products more suited for small businesses as a way to add more revenue. Creating these products may not require a heavy lift as they could be built upon AI and other technologies that Adobe is already using including SQL/Postgre, which is used in machine learning. This could be helpful to help small businesses make better use of their marketing dollars by targeting customers with the highest spend potential. 

In conclusion, Adobe is a great example of a company that didn’t stop learning and saw how it could grow by acquiring companies with specialized tech offerings to make its products stronger.
